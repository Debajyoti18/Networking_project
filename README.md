<h1>Problem Statement: Multi-Branch Office Network Setup</h1> 
<h3>Objective:</h3> 
<p>Design and configure a network for a company with two branches in different cities, connected via a WAN link. Implement subnetting, routing, and Port Address Translation (PAT) to ensure efficient communication between branches and secure access to the internet. </p>
<h3>Scenario: </h3>
<p>A company operates from two branches: Head Office (HO) and Branch Office (BO). Each 
branch has multiple departments that need to communicate internally and access the internet 
via a shared public IP. The following requirements must be met: 
1. Subnetting must be used to allocate IP addresses efficiently for departments within 
each branch. 
2. Routing must be configured to enable communication between the two branches over 
the WAN link. 
3. Port Address Translation (PAT) must be implemented to provide internet access to 
all devices using a single public IP. 
4. The design must ensure scalability for future department additions. </p>
