# Networking Project

## Problem Statement: Multi-Branch Office Network Setup

### Objective
Design and configure a network for a company with two branches in different cities, connected via a WAN link. Implement subnetting, routing, and Port Address Translation (PAT) to ensure efficient communication and internet access.

### Scenario
A company operates from two branches: Head Office (HO) and Branch Office (BO). Each branch has multiple departments that need to communicate internally and access the internet via a shared public IP. The following requirements must be met:
1. **Subnetting**: Allocate IP addresses efficiently for departments within each branch.
2. **Routing**: Enable communication between the two branches over the WAN link.
3. **Port Address Translation (PAT)**: Provide internet access to all devices using a single public IP.
4. **Scalability**: Ensure the design can accommodate future department additions.
